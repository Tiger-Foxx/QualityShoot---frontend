QUALITYSHOOT - END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (EULA)

Welcome to QualityShoot, the AI-powered image and video upscaler, crafted with love (and a bit of coffee) by FOX.

----------------------------------------

QualityShoot is an open source project.
You can view, modify, fork, improve, and even (kindly) criticize the source code at:

3. WHAT YOU CANNOT DO

----------------------------------------
4. NO WARRANTY

QualityShoot is provided "as is", with no warranties of any kind.
If your cat becomes too beautiful after an upscale, you use this program at your own risk.
FOX cannot be held responsible for overly sharp images or the mysterious disappearance of pixels.
